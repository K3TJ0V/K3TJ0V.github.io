## CV development

I created this site with my knowledge after participating in a Maciej Korsan's frontend course. 
The purpose of this project was to use everything that I learned in 13 weeks of course.
Now I'm using it to create my CV in case when I would like to court for my first job
as a junior frontend developer.
